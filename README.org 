#+TITLE:C to MIPS compiler
#+AUTHOR:Joel Grunbaum

This was an assignment I had while I was on exchange at the University of Edinburgh.
Its a compiler for a modified C language to the MIPS assembly. 
This was written using Intellij IDEA, so I suggest you use that to build if you want to try it for yourself.

Information about the language can be found in the grammar folder as well as in desc.
Overall it was a pretty neat assignment, and I'm honestly surprised it worked as well as it did.
